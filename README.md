## project-euler
Selected [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems and my solutions to them. A brief description of each problem's approach is written in comments.
When possible, I try to solve a general version of the problem provided in the statement.

Each problem script can be run individually with `python pXXX.py [options]`. Currently, solutions are written in Python 3.7.3.
The available options are ones I use most frequently in the problem-solving process: checks/tests, progress printing, and timing. See `utils.py` for usage and more details.

To calculate solutions for multiple problems at once, use `python solve.py [options] [space-separated problem numbers]` with the same options as above, e.g. `python solve.py 1 2 3`.
If no problem numbers are provided, solutions to all available problems will be calculated.

Happy problem-solving!
